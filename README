Upload GPS coordinates and share them with other users.  The application
allows you to share and display location data using the Open Street Maps
map data.  This project will eventually be paired with an Android
application for sharing location data between authenticated phones.

I built it with lots of help from Miguel Grinberg's awesome book Flask
Web Development.  Some code has been lifted directly from his repo and
was originally licensed under the MIT License.  The code from the Flasky
projects remains under the MIT License, but all modifications and all
new code are GPLv3+.
